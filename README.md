# Case Study: Automating QuickBooks Data Extraction & Transformation

## Background
Our company relies on QuickBooks for managing sales data, but retrieving historical transaction records proved to be a major bottleneck. With **over 13,000 customers** and **20 years of sales data**, QuickBooks struggled to process queries beyond **4,000 line items**, often resulting in incomplete datasets or outright system crashes. This limitation made it **impossible to build targeted email lists** for crucial business operations, such as:
- Identifying **dormant customers** for re-engagement.
- **Checking in** with customers who haven‚Äôt ordered recently.
- **Targeting customers** by geographic location.

To gain full access to our historical data, we needed an **automated, scalable** solution to systematically extract, structure, and utilize our sales records.

## Problem Statement
### Challenges with QuickBooks Data Retrieval:
1. **Query Limits & System Crashes**
   - QB could not retrieve more than **4,000 line items** at a time.
   - Large queries **timed out** or **crashed the system**.
   - Resulted in **small, incomplete datasets**.

2. **Inefficient Manual Exporting**
   - Exporting data manually month-by-month for 20 years was impractical.
   - Prone to **human error, inconsistencies, and massive time consumption**.

3. **Data Fragmentation**
   - Extracted files were in **disorganized CSV formats**.
   - Needed **customer and invoice grouping**.
   - Could not **easily extract insights** for business decisions.

## Solution: Automating Data Extraction & Transformation
### Step 1: Automated Data Extraction with PyAutoGUI
We built a **Python script using PyAutoGUI** to automate the export of QuickBooks data **one month at a time** over 20 years. This approach allowed us to:

‚úÖ Avoid QuickBooks' **query limits** and **crash issues**.  
‚úÖ Ensure **complete historical data retrieval**.  
‚úÖ **Eliminate human error** in the manual exporting process.  

### Step 2: Structuring Data with Python
Once the raw CSV files were extracted, we developed a **data transformation pipeline**:
- **CSV Parsing:** A script reads the exported CSV files, detects headers, and extracts **customer purchase data**.
- **Customer Aggregation:** Transactions are grouped by **customer name** and **invoice number**.
- **Data Cleaning:** Duplicate and redundant fields (e.g., contact details in every row) are removed.
- **Sharding & JSON Conversion:** The data is transformed into a **structured JSON format** for easy querying and analysis.

### Step 3: Enabling Advanced Business Insights
With the structured JSON database, we unlocked **new business capabilities**:

‚úÖ **Dormant Customer Lists**: Identified customers who haven't ordered in a specific timeframe.  
‚úÖ **Geographic Targeting**: Filtered customers by city/state for location-based outreach.  
‚úÖ **Sales Trends Analysis**: Identified seasonal purchasing patterns and high-value customers.
