# Case Study: Automating QuickBooks Data Extraction & Transformation

## Background
Our company relies on QuickBooks for managing sales data, but retrieving historical transaction records proved to be a major bottleneck. With **over 13,000 customers** and **20 years of sales data**, QuickBooks struggled to process queries beyond **4,000 line items** (wherein each customer averaged around 250 line items), often resulting in incomplete datasets or outright system crashes. This limitation made it **impossible to build targeted email lists** for crucial business operations, such as:
- Identifying **dormant customers** for re-engagement.
- **Targeting customers** by geographic location.

To gain full access to our historical data, we needed an **automated, scalable** solution to systematically extract, structure, and utilize our sales records.

## Solution: Automating Data Extraction & Transformation
### Step 1: Automated Data Extraction with PyAutoGUI
I built a **Python script using PyAutoGUI** to automate the export of QuickBooks data **one month at a time** over 20 years. This approach allowed us to:

‚úÖ Avoid QuickBooks' **query limits** and **crash issues**.  
‚úÖ Ensure **complete historical data retrieval**.  
‚úÖ **Eliminate human error** in the manual exporting process.  

### Step 2: Structuring Data with Python
Once the raw CSV files were extracted, I developed a **data transformation pipeline**:
- **CSV Parsing:** A script reads the exported CSV files, detects headers, and extracts **customer purchase data**.
- **Customer Aggregation:** Transactions are grouped by **customer name** and **invoice number**.
- **Data Cleaning:** Duplicate and redundant fields (e.g., contact details in every row) are removed.
- **Sharding & JSON Conversion:** The data is transformed into a **structured JSON format** for easy querying and analysis.

### Step 3: Sample Data for Testing
To facilitate testing and reproducibility, I have included **sample QuickBooks-style CSV files** in this repository. These files:

‚úÖ Follow the same structure as real QuickBooks exports.  
‚úÖ Contain **randomized, redacted customer data** for privacy.  
‚úÖ Allow developers to test the pipeline without needing real sensitive data.  

You can find the sample CSV file in the repository: [`sample_qb_export.csv`](sample_qb_export.csv).

### Step 4: Enabling Advanced Business Insights
With the structured JSON database, we unlocked **new business capabilities**:

‚úÖ **Dormant Customer Lists**: Identified customers who haven't ordered in a specific timeframe.  
‚úÖ **Geographic Targeting**: Filtered customers by city/state for location-based outreach.  
‚úÖ **Sales Trends Analysis**: Identified seasonal purchasing patterns and high-value customers.  
‚úÖ **CRM & Sales Software Exporting**: Enabled direct integration with third-party **CRM systems** and **sales automation platforms**.  
‚úÖ **Dynamic Marketing Campaigns**: Created personalized marketing outreach based on **purchase behavior**.  
‚úÖ **Data Monetization**: Provided structured insights for **business strategy and investor reports**.
